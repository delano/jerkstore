= JerkStore, storing data on disk like an asshole

== What is JerkStore?

JerkStore is a database alternative for mostly-read applications. 


= Why is it called JerkStore?

Because you have to be an asshole to specifically not use a database.


== What is the Project Status?

_Pre-Alpha_

I'm using JerkStore in my projects, but I don't recommend it yet for external consumption. It needs more training.
